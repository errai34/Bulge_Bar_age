Age of the X-shaped region of the bulge/bar project

/w Daisuke Kawata and Yuan-Sen Ting

To do:
Step 1.
* Retrieve “best asteroseismic data” from A. Miglio. 

Done. All the data is in the data folder, but with and without cuts. Wrote a code called process_andrea_data to process the files and put them into a format that can be used easily with the analysis.

Have to check that the data I created in Aug 2020, which I use currently, Rcut_andrea_data_proc.csv, is the same as andrea_merged_clean.csv, which I plan to use in the future.

* Match APOGEE DR16 with Gaia EDR3]

* Match with APOGEE DR16 (strange [M/H]?)

Done. Code is in notebooks.

* Gaia EDR3 correct the photometry (different zero points depending on the astrometric solution), find code on Gaia archive

To do.

* Train BINGO on Kepler x APOGEE DR15 x EDR3 (age, chemistry and photometry). All the Routines to do this are in the Routines folder.

To do.
